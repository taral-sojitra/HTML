        In the realm of web, where codes unfold,
        MERN stack developers, brave and bold.
        With MongoDB as their loyal mate,
        They store data in documents, oh so great!

        Express.js comes next, swift and sleek,
        Routing requests with a magic tweak.
        Node.js powers their server might,
        Handling requests with speed and light.

        React shines bright in the client's view,
        UI components, old and new.
        With Redux managing state with ease,
        Their front-end dances, a symphony of keys.

        In the world of MERN, they craft and create,
        Applications modern, at a rapid rate.
        With JavaScript as their language of choice,
        They code with passion, a developer's rejoice!

        So here's to the MERN stack brigade,
        Building the web, where dreams are made.
        With MongoDB, Express, React, and Node,
        They conquer challenges, in code they bode.
