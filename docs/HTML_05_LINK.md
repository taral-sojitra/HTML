# LINKS IN HTML

The `<a>` tag, also referred to as the anchor tag, is used to establish hyperlinks that link to other pages (external web pages included) or to a particular section within the same page. Here are some attributes of the `<a>` tag:

- The `href` attribute specifies the URL that the link will take the user to when clicked.
- The `download` attribute specifies that the target or resource clicked is a downloadable file.
- The `target` attribute specifies where the linked document or resource should be opened. This could be in the same window or a new window.
