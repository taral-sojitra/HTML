# IMAGES IN HTML

In HTML, we use the `<img/>` tag to insert images into the document.
Here are some attributes of the `<img/>` tag:
- `src` is used to specify the location of the image on your computer or the internet.
- `alt` specifies alternative text that displays if the image cannot be rendered. This text is also helpful for screen readers.
- `height` determines the height of the image.
- `width` determines the width of the image.
- `border` specifies the thickness of the borders around the image. If no border is added, it is set to 0.

```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="Code Help Logo" width="200" height="200">
```
